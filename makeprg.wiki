use the command :h makeprg to see more detail

simple example:
*:set makeprg=gcc\ %*  (% means the current file)
then when you run *:make*, it will compile the current file

if there are errors, you can use :copen to see and locate these errors.

you can use
*:set makeprg=gcc\ %\ &&\ ./a.out*
to compile and run the file
