This plugin is aimed at making it more convenient to compile or run a single
source file without leaving vim.

Consider this situation: you have just written a small c source file for a
small test, but you have to write a Makefile to compile it or exit vim to
compile it or compile it using "!gcc" without quickfix feature because vim's
make command only use the "make" command? This plugin will help you out.
