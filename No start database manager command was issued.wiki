++ No start database manager command was issued

Hi Sam,
Is this solved? If not, just do the following.
0. Login as the Instance owner. [if you have installed db2 as 
Administrator, then login as Administrator]
1. Open a db2 command prompt.
Then, Start->run->db2cmd
A command prompt will open.
2. There you run the command 
db2 start db manager 
It should say that it is started if it is not started
or 
it should say that it is active if it is active.
If the error is different, then try this
db2 start db manager user db2admin USING db2admin
The word after the USING is the password of db2admin. If you 
have changed the password of db2admin, then use that password.
3. Now open the Control Center and try to create the database.
